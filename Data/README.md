# Data Folder

This folder contains essential resources for connecting to the PostgreSQL database, querying the data, and analyzing the results. Below is a breakdown of the files and their purposes:

### 1. [PostgreSQL-URL](./PostgreSQL-URL)
This file provides the PostgreSQL connection URL to access the **TravelTide** database. Use this link to connect and explore the data directly.

### 2. [SQL-Query.sql](./SQL-Query.sql)
This file contains the SQL query used to retrieve data from the TravelTide database. The query includes specific filters to:
- Focus on recent user sessions (starting from January 4, 2023) to ensure data relevance.
- Exclude older trips, as they may not reflect the current user behavior and patterns.

### 3. [Query-Results.csv](./Query-Results.csv)
This file stores the results of the SQL query in CSV format. It allows for further analysis and serves as a basis for segmentation and insights generation.
